###Code history

On December 2nd, [we committed a change][5] to restructure Npgsql code. This change modified file locations and unfortunately made the complete modification history of those files to not be available anymore through GitHub interface directly. [This stackoverflow post][6] documents a way to access the history before the rename: You just need to access the object tree **before** the rename and then you can see the rest of the file history.
In the case of this rename, this is the tree: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/tree/2f8928e4dee59275767de0df2ec41a654744a3bc

This will help future searches for the history of the files. Note that you stil can access the complete history of the file through command line: `git log --follow ./newflodername/file`
