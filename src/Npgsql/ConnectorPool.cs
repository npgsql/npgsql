        //
        // * When we're at capacity (Busy==Max) further open attempts wait until someone releases.
        //   This must happen in FIFO (first to block on open is the first to release), otherwise some attempts may get
        //   starved and time out. This is why we use a ConcurrentQueue.
        // * We must avoid a race condition whereby an open attempt starts waiting at the same time as another release
        //   puts a connector back into the idle list. This would potentially make the waiter wait forever/time out.
        //
        // Rules
        // * You *only* create a new connector if Total < Max.
        // * You *only* go into waiting if Busy == Max (which also implies Idle == 0)
