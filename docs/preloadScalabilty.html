	    <h1>Scalability of "Preload Reader" Connection-String Option</h1>
	    <p>
	        The following graph compares the time take to return the first and last rows of a large request
	        of varying sizes. Precise figures are not given as they depend too much upon record size, connection
	        to database, CPU and memory of the machine and so on, and what is of significance is the comparative
	        performance of the two methods on the same machine under roughly similar conditions.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	        As can be seen, the time to return the first row of results (blue) remains practically nil for preloading
	        not being used no matter how many results are return, while the time to return all results (black) increases
	        linearly.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Meanwhile, the time to return all results with preloading turned on (red) increases far more rapidly and
	        does not scale linearly with 90,000 or so rows being a practical maximum on the machine used. The time to
	        the first result is almost as long as that to the last, which prevents desktop applications from rendering
	        partial results, web applications from writing to an unbuffered web-stream, and so on.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        If you have multiple users (e.g. with a web application) the effects upon memory are even more significant.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	        The memory usage of a datareader without preloading used (grey) remains low throughout, while that used with
	        preloading (purple) increases with the number of rows. It is this that made 90,000 a practical maximum on the test
	        machine.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Since available memory is a resource shared between different threads, the impact of this will be greater
	        in applications like web applications, because each request will impact upon the others.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        For this reason, it is recommended that code which depends upon preloading of datareaders be changed to no
	        longer require it, and the option turned off.
