# Npgsql 4.1 (preview)

Preview versions of the Npgsql ADO driver are available on nuget. 

## New Features

The major new features of 4.1 are:

* Support for reading and writing your types as JSON via the new, high-perf System.Text.Json API ([#2306](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2306)).
* Support for the new async methods introduced in .NET Standard 2.1 ([#2481](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2481)).
* Expose performance statistics via [the new .NET event counters](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-diagnostics-improvements-in-net-core-3-0/) ([#1725](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1725)).
* Async support for binary imports and exports ([#1632](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1632)).
* Easier and PostgreSQL standard ways to provide client certificates for authentication ([#2129](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2129)).
