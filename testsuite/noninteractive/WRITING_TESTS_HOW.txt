This document explains how to write noninteractive tests for Npgsql.



To add a test case in the noninteractive suite, the following guidelines must be followed:

 - Name your test files "test_xxx.cs" where xxx could be anything you like. 
 - Add a file named "expected_yyy" where yyy should be equal to xxx used for the test file.
 - Use the NpgsqlTests.getConnectionString() function to retrieve the connection string used to connect to the test database. Include the Npgsql.NpgsqlTests namespace for that.
 - Should you need special database support for your test case, i.e. certain tables, views, functions, or data, add them in the appropriate add_zzz.sql file where zzz in <tables,views,functions,data>.
 - Make sure you do not commit test files that have debug logging enabled and printable.

That's it. Look at test_1.cs for an example.




To run the noninteractive suite, run:

$ make

To clean up the mess the noninteractive suite creates, run:

$ make clean
