## Major Changes


## Breaking Changes from 3.2

> [!Warning]
> The API for binary import (COPY IN) has changed substantially in a breaking way, and code from 3.2 will *not* work as-is on 3.3.
>
> You must now call `NpgsqlBinaryImporter.Commit()` to save your imported data; not doing so will roll the operation back. `NpgsqlBinaryImporter.Cancel()` has been removed - simply closing/disposing the importer will implicitly cancel the import. This is similar to how `TransactionScope` works and is necessary to prevent accidental commit of data on exception. See [#1646](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1646).

* Parameter types have become more strict. Previous versions allowed to you pass arbitrary value types, such as writing CLR string to int columns, or anything that implemented IConvertible. Although some implicit conversions are still supported (e.g. long -> int, short -> int), some have been removed.
* The following APIs "connection capability" APIs have been removed from NpgsqlConnection: `UseConformantStrings`, `SupportsEStringPrefix`, `UseSslStream`.
* The default name translator, `NpgsqlSnakeCaseNameTranslator`, has been changed to handle acronyms better. Given the property name `IsJSON`, the old translator algorithm would output `is_j_s_o_n`, while the new outputs `is_json`. To revert back to the old algorithm, create a `NpgsqlSnakeCaseNameTranslator` instance with `legacyMode: true` and pass it when calling the `MapComposite` and `MapEnum` methods.
