## General

Npgsql includes a built-in feature for outputting logging events which can help debug issues.

Npgsql logging is disabled by default and must be turned on. Logging can be turned on by setting `NpgsqlLogManager.Provider` to a class implementing the `INpgsqlLoggingProvider` interface. Npgsql comes with a console implementation which can be set up as follows:

{% highlight C# %}

NpgsqlLogManager.Provider = new ???

{% endhighlight %}

*Note: you must set the logging provider *before* invoking any other Npgsql method, at the very start of your program.*

It's trivial to create a logging provider that passes log messages to whatever logging framework you use. You can find such an adaptor for NLog [here](http://ni).

*Note:* the logging API is a first implementation and will probably improve/change - don't treat it as a stable part of the Npgsql API. Let us know if you think there are any missing messages or features!

## ConsoleLoggingProvider

Npgsql comes with one built-in logging provider: ConsoleLoggingProvider. It will simply dump all log messages with a given level or above to stdanrd output.
You can set it up by including the following line at the beginning of your application:

{% highlight C# %}
NpgsqlLogManager.Provider = new ConsoleLoggingProvider(<min level>, <print level?>, <print connector id?>);
{% endhighlight %}

Level defaults to `NpgsqlLogLevel.Info` (which will only print warnings and errors).
You can also have log levels and connector IDs logged.

## NLogLoggingProvider (or implementing your own)

The following provider is used in the Npgsql unit tests to pass log messages to [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/).
You're welcome to copy-paste it into your project, or to use it as a starting point for implementing your own custom provider.

{% highlight C# %}
class NLogLoggingProvider : INpgsqlLoggingProvider
{
    public NpgsqlLogger CreateLogger(string name)
    {
        return new NLogLogger(name);
    }
}

class NLogLogger : NpgsqlLogger
{
    readonly Logger _log;

    internal NLogLogger(string name)
    {
        _log = LogManager.GetLogger(name);
    }

    public override bool IsEnabled(NpgsqlLogLevel level)
    {
        return _log.IsEnabled(ToNLogLogLevel(level));
    }

    public override void Log(NpgsqlLogLevel level, int connectorId, string msg, Exception exception = null)
    {
        var ev = new LogEventInfo(ToNLogLogLevel(level), "", msg);
        if (exception != null)
            ev.Exception = exception;
        if (connectorId != 0)
            ev.Properties["ConnectorId"] = connectorId;
        _log.Log(ev);
    }

    static LogLevel ToNLogLogLevel(NpgsqlLogLevel level)
    {
        switch (level)
        {
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Trace:
            return LogLevel.Trace;
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Debug:
            return LogLevel.Debug;
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Info:
            return LogLevel.Info;
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Warn:
            return LogLevel.Warn;
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Error:
            return LogLevel.Error;
        case NpgsqlLogLevel.Fatal:
            return LogLevel.Fatal;
        default:
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("level");
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
